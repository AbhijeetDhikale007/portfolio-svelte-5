    Manage packages.

Nix is a functional package manager and language that can be used for: 
    Managing development environments: Nix can manage every file and application on your OS, and have multiple projects on the same system. 
    Creating reproducible builds: Nix helps ensure that two people building the same package will always get the same output. 
    Cross-platform compatibility: Nix can help with cross-platform compatibility. 
    Binary caching: Nix uses binary caches for transparent build caching. 
    Describing packages: The Nix language is used to describe packages and create derivations, which are precise descriptions of how to derive new files from existing files.

Some other benefits of Nix include:
    Easy installation of software over URLs.
    Easy transfer of software environments between computers.
    Declarative specification of Linux machines.
    Reproducible integration testing using virtual machines.
    Avoiding version conflicts with already installed software.
    Installing software from source code.
