C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.\n\nC++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems. C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms. C++ is fun and easy to learn! As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa."}

export const Svelte: Array = [
    { Title: 'Svelte', Img: 'Icons/Svelte.svg', Alt: 'Svelte', Info: "Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Unlike traditional frameworks like React or Vue, which do much of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts the work to a build step. This means that Svelte compiles your components into efficient JavaScript code at build time, rather than at runtime, resulting in faster performance and a smaller bundle size.\n\nCompile-Time Framework: Svelte compiles components into highly optimized vanilla JavaScript at build time, which reduces the amount of code that needs to be sent to the browser and improves loading times.\n\nReactivity: Svelte uses a unique approach to reactivity. Instead of relying on a virtual DOM, Svelte updates the DOM directly when state changes occur, leading to more efficient updates and a smoother user experience.\n\nSimplicity and Readability: Svelte syntax is designed to be straightforward, making it easy to understand and use. The framework allows developers to write less boilerplate code, which can lead to more maintainable applications.\n\nNo Virtual DOM: By eliminating the virtual DOM, Svelte can directly manipulate the DOM, resulting in less overhead and better performance, especially in dynamic applications with many UI updates.\n\nScoped Styles: Svelte allows for scoped CSS styles, meaning styles defined within a component are only applied to that component. This helps avoid style conflicts and makes it easier to manage styles in large applications.\n\nBuilt-In Animation Support: Svelte has built-in support for animations and transitions, allowing developers to easily add engaging animations to their applications with minimal effort.\n\nRich Ecosystem: While Svelte itself is minimalistic, it has a growing ecosystem of libraries and tools, including Sapper (a framework for building web applications with Svelte) and SvelteKit (a framework for building full-stack applications).\n\nEcosystem Tools: Svelte's ecosystem includes tools like SvelteKit, which streamlines the development of Svelte applications with features such as routing, server-side rendering, and static site generation."}

export const React: Array = [
    { Title: 'React', Img: 'Icons/React.svg', Alt: 'React', Info: "React is a popular open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications (SPAs). Developed and maintained by Facebook, React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data without reloading the page. Its component-based architecture and declarative style make it a widely-used choice for front-end development.\n\nComponent-Based Architecture: React encourages the development of reusable components, allowing developers to encapsulate logic and presentation in self-contained units. This modular approach promotes code reusability and easier maintenance.\n\nJSX Syntax: React uses JSX (JavaScript XML), which allows developers to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript code. JSX makes it easier to visualize the structure of the UI and improves the readability of the code.\n\nVirtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance. When the state of an application changes, React creates a virtual representation of the DOM, compares it to the previous version, and updates only the parts of the actual DOM that have changed. This minimizes direct manipulation of the DOM, which can be slow.\n\nUnidirectional Data Flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow model, meaning that data flows from parent components to child components. This makes it easier to understand how data changes affect the UI, leading to more predictable applications.\n\nState Management: React manages component state effectively with built-in hooks like useState and useReducer. For more complex state management across larger applications, libraries such as Redux or Context API can be integrated.\n\nLifecycle Methods and Hooks: React components have lifecycle methods (in class components) that allow developers to hook into different stages of a component's lifecycle. With the introduction of hooks in React 16.8, functional components can now also manage state and side effects, making it easier to share logic between components."}

It is designed to facilitate the development of dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs) and is built using TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript. Angular provides a comprehensive set of tools and features that support a structured approach to building complex applications.\n\nComponent-Based Architecture: Angular applications are built using components, which encapsulate the logic, template, and styling of a portion of the UI. This modular approach promotes reusability and better organization of code.\n\nTypeScript: Angular is written in TypeScript, which adds static typing to JavaScript. TypeScript helps catch errors at compile time and improves code quality and readability, making it easier to manage large codebases.\n\nDependency Injection: Angular has a built-in dependency injection system that simplifies the management of services and their dependencies. This promotes better organization of code and makes it easier to test components.\n\nTwo-Way Data Binding: Angular supports two-way data binding, allowing automatic synchronization between the model and the view. When the model changes, the view updates automatically, and vice versa, simplifying the development process.\n\nDirectives: Angular uses directives to extend HTML with custom attributes and behaviors. Directives can manipulate the DOM, create reusable components, and manage state, enhancing the capabilities of standard HTML.\n\nRouting: Angular provides a powerful routing module that allows developers to define navigation paths within the application. This makes it easy to create SPAs with multiple views and dynamic URL handling.'}
