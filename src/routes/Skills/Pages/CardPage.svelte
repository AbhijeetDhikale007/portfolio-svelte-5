        <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. - wikipedia

            That's impressive and all, but you know what's also impressive ? shooting yourself in the foot while writing some code with this language:
            
            
            '11' + 1; // 111 : fair enough, string concatenation !
            '11' - 1; // 10  : why ???
            
            Jokes aside, I enjoyed learning this weird language, I loved creating interactive websites, from using only vanilla js, then React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Solid, to creating my own SPA framework called Recursive inspired by React and Flutter, which was a real eye-opener and made me skip (to some degree) some learning steps, as I am aware of what really happens internally.
            
            Let's say, I am not your average javascript developer ðŸ˜œ.</p>
